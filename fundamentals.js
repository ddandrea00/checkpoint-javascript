// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `colors` that contains three colors.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var colors = ["green","blue","yellow"]

// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var last = colors.last

// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteColors`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var favoriteColors = []

// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `colors` to `favoriteColors`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

for(i = 0; i < colors.length; i++){
  favoriteColors.push(i)
}

// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var instructor = {

  name: "Ronald McDonald"
  age: "37"
  height: "6'5"


}

// #6: Add a `facial-hair` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

instructor.push(facial-hair: false)
